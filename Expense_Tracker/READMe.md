# Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing object-oriented programming concepts. It involves creating two main classes: Expense and ExpenseDatabase. These classes are designed to model and manage financial expenses. 

The idea behind this project is to acquire practical knowledge by defining classes to represent real-world expense data, implementing data handling and manipulation techniques, and working with time-related functionalities. Below is a preview of the class attributes and methods.

## Class Summary
### Expense Class:

Represents an individual financial expense.

**Attributes:**
1. **```id```**: A unique identifier generated as a UUID string.
2. **```title```**: A string representing the title of the expense.
3. **```amount```**: A float representing the amount of the expense.
4. **```created_at```**: A timestamp indicating when the expense was created (UTC).
5. **```updated_at```**: A timestamp indicating the last time the expense was updated (UTC).

**Methods:**
1. **```__init__```**: Initializes the attributes.
2. **```update```**: Allows updating the title and/or amount, updating the updated_at timestamp.
3. **```to_dict```**: Returns a dictionary representation of the expense.


   
### ExpenseDatabase class

Manages a collection of Expense objects.

**Attributes:**
1. **```expenses```**: A list storing Expense instances.
   
**Methods:**
1. **```__init__```**: Initializes the list.
2. **```add_expense```**: Adds an expense.
3. **```remove_expense```**: Removes an expense.
4. **```get_expense_by_id```**: Retrieves an expense by ID.
5. **```get_expense_by_title```**: Retrieves expenses by title.

## Instructions

### Expense class

1. Implement an __init__ method to initialize the attributes.
2. Implement an update method that allows updating the title and/or amount of the
expense. The updated_at attribute should be automatically set to the current UTC
timestamp whenever an update occurs.
3. Implement a to_dict method that returns a dictionary representation of the expense.

### ExpenseDB class

1. Implement an __init__ method to initialize the expenses list.
2. Implement methods to:
   * Add an expense to the database.
   * Remove an expense from the database.
   * Get an expense by ID.
   * Get expenses by title (returning a list).
3. Create a to_dict method that returns a list of dictionaries representing each expense in
the database.

## Execution

### Expense class

#### **1. Implement an __init__ method to initialize the attributes.**
```python
import uuid 
from datetime import datetime, timezone

class Expense:
    def __init__(self, title, amount):
        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.title = title
        self.amount = amount
        self.created_at = datetime.utcnow()
        self.updated_at = self.created_at
```
This code sets up a basic expense tracking system with unique IDs, titles, amounts, and timestamps for creation and last update.

The uuid is set to uuid4 because this version generates a random UUID, which has a very low chance of collision with other UUIDs. The ```self.updated_at``` matches the ```self.created_at``` because when an Expense object is first created, it has not been updated yet, so the ```updated_at``` timestamp is set to be the same as the ```created_at``` timestamp.

#### **2. Implement an update method that allows updating the title and/or amount of the expense.** 
```python    
    def update(self, title = None, amount = None):
        if title is not None:
            self.title = title
        if amount is not None:
            self.amount = amount
        self.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()
```
 This update method allows you to modify the title and/or amount of an existing expense and updates the timestamp for the last update. If no new title or amount is provided, the method does not make any changes to the respective attributes, but it still updates the ```updated_at``` timestamp.

#### **3. Implement a to_dict method that returns a dictionary representation of the expense.**
```python
    def to_dict(self):
        return {
        "id": self.id,
        "title": self.title,
        "amount": self.amount,
        "created_at": self.created_at.isoformat(),
        "updated_at": self.updated_at.isoformat()
        }
```
This method creates a dictionary with the key-value pairs. When you call the to_dict method on an instance of the Expense class, it will return a dictionary containing the details of that expense. 

The creation and updated timestamp of the expense is in ISO 8601 format. ```The isoformat()``` method is used to convert the datetime object to a string in ISO format. This format provides a standardized and unambiguous way to represent dates and times.

### ExpenseDatabase class

#### **1. Implement an __init__ method to initialize the expenses list.**
```python      
class ExpenseDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expenses = []
```
The ExpenseDatabase class is created to represent an expense database. An empty list called ```expenses``` is initialized to provide a foundation for storing and managing instances of the Expense class.

#### **2. Implement methods to:**
   * Add an expense to the database.
```python
    def add_expense(self, expense):
        self.expenses.append(expense)
```
This method adds an expense object to the database.
   
   * Remove an expense from the database.
```python
    def remove_expense(self, expense_id):
        self.expenses = [exp for exp in self.expenses if exp.id != expense_id]
```
The remove_expense method removes a specific expense from this database based on its unique ID.  The process involves checking each expense in the database; an expense is included in the newly created list only if its ID does not match the expense_id.
   
   * Get an expense by ID.
```python
    def get_expense_by_id(self, expense_id):
        for exp in self.expenses:
            if exp.id == expense_id:
                return exp
        return None
```
This method retrieves an expense by it's ID. If the id of the current expense matches expense_id, the found expense is returned. If no expense with the matching ID is found, 'None' is returned.
                  
   * Get expenses by title (returning a list).
```python
    def get_expense_by_title(self, title):
        return [expense for expense in self.expenses if expense.title == title]
```
This method retrieves a list of expenses by their title. 

#### **3. Create a to_dict method that returns a list of dictionaries representing each expense in the database.**
```python
    def to_dict(self):
        return [expense.to_dict() for expense in self.expenses]
```
The to_dict method creates a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents the attributes of an expense in the database.
